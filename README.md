# How to run

We created an UI for this assingment which we explain how to use, in addition we added an section called example that shows through pictures how to use it

1. Run the Main
2. Enter the values of the targil: Important Note</br>
   The L values will have to be enter differently</br>
   L = [(1,1,0),(3,2,1),(3,1,-1)] -> 1,1,0;3,2,1;3,1,-1
3. Run Create Environment First
4. Run any of the RL models to see the results in the UI

**Note:** We Added the file of the GridWorld with changed L values for ease of use

# Final Results:

To See the final results we added two things:
1. A Button Called Results that will print the differences between all models and their average in the terminal
2. When Clicking on  a specific model we print the Value function in the terminal
